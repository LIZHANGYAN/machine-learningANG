## What is machine learning?
> Arth Samuel(1959). Maching learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

灵感来源于Samuel编写的西洋棋程序。

> Tom Mitchell(1998). Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experence E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

以西洋棋为例

> E= the experience of playing many games of checkers.<br>
> T= the task of playing checkers.<br>
> P= the probability that the program will win the next game.
